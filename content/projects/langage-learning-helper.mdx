I am building this for 2 reasons:
- 1 - it's helpful to me as I am currently learning Bahasa Malayu
- 2 - I want to build a full-stack application to a a professional-standard, similar to that which you would see in a start-up

To mirror a professional-standard project, the tech stack includes:
- App deployment on vercel
- SQL database deployment on NeonDb
- Database migrations with Prisma
- Full typechecking with Typescript (icluding typechecking of SQL queries by integrating with Prisma)
- A CICD pipeline, which checks thqt code linting and formatting is correct before allowing release
- Fully automated deployment via Github Action
