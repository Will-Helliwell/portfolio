I work a lot on MakeMyHouseGreen's proprietary model, which takes into account location, weather and property-specific data to model the interaction between different green home products (solar panels, batteries, ev chargers etc.) to give the user an idea of the cost, annual payback and annual carbon savings for different installation options.
